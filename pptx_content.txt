  - Circular economy based concrete production ÔÇô TODAY
  - Over the past 10 years, we have led, advised, and helped hundreds of companies to develop and grow their business and succeed in the global market and at the same time become more sustainable. It is our passion to help companies grow and succeed sustainably. 
We have recognised that despite efforts in the construction industry, focus on more sustainable concrete has been to reduce one of more raw materials, whereas we want to focus on circular economy and its tremendous potential in reducing CO2 and improving profitability.  
Working together with inventors, university research and construction professionals we have developed a methodology, mixing and process to better utilise demolished concrete and produce stronger concrete, with less cement, less costs and significantly reduced carbon footprint.

  - Carbon Free Technologies (or ÔÇ£CFT) has developed patented solutions for creating recycled carbon neutral concrete utilising recycled construction demolition concrete waste mixed with fully bio-based application dependent additives (ÔÇ£RCAÔÇØ). This solution is based on over 10 years of research and cooperation with universities, research institutes and other constituents. Producing the recycled concrete can be done both in concrete facilities and on-site.
  - CFT combines its innovations with its AI driven digital platform that allows us to manage the entire RCA value chain ÔÇô all based on on-boarding of customer requirements and matching that with applicable RCA, as well as creates a marketplace for service providers in the value chain to become a part of the solution ÔÇô all from one integrated ecosystem, one single dashboard.
  - CFT innovations combined with an AI driven digital platform provide a fully scalable holistics approach to sustainable concrete production instead of trying to solve only one challenge in the value chain. In todayÔÇÖs environment providing such holistic circular economy solutions is the only option to solve the various financial and environmental challenges of producing concrete. 
CFT was established by a team of sustainable business professionals with versatile backgrounds ÔÇô from construction operations and other fields of business with unparallelled expertise.
  - Innovations: More than 10 years of R&D
  - Solution: Replace aggregates with RCA
  - combined with application-based additives and controlled value chain
  - Impact: Substantial reduction of waste, CO2 and materially stronger concrete ÔÇô significantly cheaper
  - Global: Fully modular and scalable with planned projects and pilots in several countries globally
Practical: Compatible with existing equipment ÔÇô no new capex required

  - Demand for circular economy solutions in concrete production is rapidly increasing due to need to reduce dependence on virgin materials and waste, to reduce the CO2 footprint in construction, have reliable access to raw materials and to lower costs.
  - Current status is environmentally unbearable
  - Waste: Today concrete production accounts for 25-35% of all waste, depending on the country ÔÇô CFT could fully utilize this waste
CO2: Concrete is one of largest sources of CO2 globally (largely due to cement production) ÔÇô CFT could reduce the CO2 footprint
Biodiversity: Ability to replace sand and gravel in concrete would protects biodiversity ÔÇô one of the corner stones in EU circular economy legislation
Other challenges: Numerous other environmental challenges can be mitigated, such as erosion, logistics, water pollution, etc.
  - Global challenges beyond ESG
  - Lack of access: Having access to suitable aggregates for concrete has become more challenging ÔÇô creating conflicts even between nations
Aggregate imports: Aggregate imports are increasing creating challenges in logistics, scheduling, and costs ÔÇô in addition to the environmental burden 
Criminal behavior: Illegal sand mining is becoming one of largest organized criminal activities in various regions 
Other challenges: Cost of logistics, increased lead times lack of efficiency and other project management concerns have become a major challenge
  - Financial opportunities relating to circular economy
  - USD +600bn industry: Continuously increasing demand for aggregates has created a USD +600 billion industry with demand for circular economy
Cheaper: Aggregate Replacing virgin aggregates with RCA Aggregates can offer a significantly cheaper alternative
Cost savings: Costs savings relating to aggregates, logistics, faster lead times, project management, on-site solutions significantly reduce project costs
CO2 reduction to profit: Being able to reduce CO2 by 0.1 tons per cubic meter of concrete can offer new avenues for additional profitability

  - Customer need drives generation of RCA (size and type of crushed concrete, type of additives, mixing plans, etc.).

On-boarding requirements and specifications from customers relating to the end-user applications are used to optimise the generation of RCA from CDW to replace aggregates when producing new concrete.

AI driven digital platform helps to manage the entire RCA value chain for access, costs and quality control.
