  Circular economy basedconcrete production ÔÇô TODAY
  Over the past 10 years, we have led, advised, and helped hundreds of companies to develop and grow their business and succeed in the global market while becoming more sustainable.We have recognised that despite efforts in the construction industry, focus on more sustainable concrete has been to reduce one or more raw materials, whereas we want to focus on circular economy and its tremendous potential in reducing CO2 and improving profitability.
  Working together with inventors, university research and construction professionals we have developed a methodology, mixing and process to better utilise demolished concrete and produce stronger concrete, with less cement, less costs and significantly reduced carbon footprint.

  Carbon Free Technologies (CFT) has developed patented solutions for creating recycled carbon neutral concrete utilising recycled construction demolition concrete waste mixed with fully bio-based application dependent additives ("RCA").This solution is based on over 10 years of research and cooperation with universities, research institutes and other constituents. Producing the recycled concrete can be done both in concrete facilities and on-site.CFT combines its innovations with an AI driven digital platform that allows us to manage the entire RCA value chain ÔÇô all based on on-boarding of customer requirements and matching that with applicable RCA.

  Market Demand
  Demand for circular economy solutions in concrete production is rapidly increasing due to the need to reduce dependence on virgin materials, waste, CO2 footprint, and to lower costs.
  Environmental Challenges
  ÔÇó Waste: Concrete accounts for 25-35% of all waste
  ÔÇó CO2: One of largest sources globally
  ÔÇó Biodiversity: Sand/gravel extraction threatens ecosystems
  ÔÇó Erosion, water pollution, logistics burden
  Global Challenges
  ÔÇó Lack of access to suitable aggregates
  ÔÇó Increasing aggregate imports
  ÔÇó Illegal sand mining ÔÇô major criminal activity
  ÔÇó Cost of logistics, lead times, efficiency
  Financial Opportunities
  ÔÇó USD +600bn aggregate industry
  ÔÇó RCA significantly cheaper alternative
  ÔÇó Cost savings: materials, logistics, waste
  ÔÇó CO2 reduction creates new profit avenues
